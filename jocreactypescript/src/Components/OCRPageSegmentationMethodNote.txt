PSM 0
 * Name: Orientation and Script 
 * Output: Orientation & Script

PSM 1
 * Name: Automatic Page Segmentation with OSD
 * Note: in all my experiments, I could not find a situation where --psm 1 obtained a result that the other PSMs could not.

PSM 2
 * Automatic Page Segmentation, But No OSD, or OCR
 * Note: It is unclear if or when Tesseract will implement this mode, but for the time being, you can safely ignore it.

PSM 3
 * Fully Automatic Page Segmentation, But No OSD 
 * Note: Default Mode, does not indicate Orientation and Script 
 * Output: Text
