PSM 0
 * Name: Orientation and Script 
 * Output: Orientation & Script

PSM 1
 * Name: Automatic Page Segmentation with OSD
 * Note: in all my experiments, I could not find a situation where --psm 1 obtained a result that the other PSMs could not.

PSM 2
 * Automatic Page Segmentation, But No OSD, or OCR
 * Note: It is unclear if or when Tesseract will implement this mode, but for the time being, you can safely ignore it.

PSM 3
 * Fully Automatic Page Segmentation, But No OSD 
 * Note: Default Mode, does not indicate Orientation and Script 
 * Output: Text

PSM 4
 * Output: Column Text Data

PSM 5
 * Similar to PSM 4, but can see rotating text 

PSM 6
 * Similar to PSM 3, but have more accurate result if all of the text have the same font

PSM 7
 * Single Line PSM 6

PSM 8
 * Single Word PSM 6

PSM 9
 * Circle Text 
 * The Worse PSM 

PSM 10 
 * One Charecter

PSM 11
 * Detecting sparse text
 * you typically donâ€™t care about the order/grouping of text, but rather the text itself.

PSM 12
 * Similar to PSM 0 + PSM 11
 * You should using PSM 0 & PSM 11 instead of PSM 12

PSM 13
 * Good for single text line 
 * There are times that OSD, segmentation,
    and other internal Tesseract-specific 
    preprocessing techniques will hurt OCR performance
    PSM 13 will stop that preprocessing techniques.
 * Use PSM 13 as the last Option
